This is a rewrite of zeus with the master written in Go.

After 'refining' the initial ruby version for a while, I finally realized how 
I should have architected it, and the master process is language-agnostic.
So I chose Go, for the better concurrency, error handling, and system integration.

It is not ready yet.
