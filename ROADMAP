ROADMAP:
  Version 1.0.0:
    - Great documentation
    - Comprehensive tests
    - Works on nearly all rails projects with no hacks (except maybe Zendesk...)
    - bulletproof dependency monitoring
    - Sane configuration DSL
    - Minimize importance of `zeus init` even further
    - On-demand loading for rarely-used / frequently-changing commands (eg. production server)
    - No lost processes.
    - Kicker/guard-like feature for autotesting (maybe pushed to post-1.0.0)

  Version 2.0.0:
    - hook-based configuration DSL
      - shouldn't need to override everything to override anything
    - Transparently start in background (no foreground `zeus start`)
    - Framework-agnostic (or at least support a bunch of them)

  Version 3.0.0:
    - Language-agnostic (pipes and signals and sockets, oh my!)
