.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Zeus makes working with large codebases much less painful\.
.
.P
It is primarily targeted at ruby and other dynamic languages, where application boot time can be tens of seconds, but it can be made to work for nearly any language\.
.
.P
Zeus lets you define common tasks, and preloads all of them in the background\. When you ask to run them, zeus transparently connects your terminal to the already\-running process in under 100ms\.
.
.P
This lets you, for example, run unit tests in dozens of milliseconds, rather than dozens of seconds\.
.
.P
Zeus also optionally monitors all files loaded by your application, and restarts as much of it as is necessary when a dependency changes\.
.
.P
To use zeus with a Ruby on Rails application, install the gem \'\fBzeus\-rails\fR\'\.
