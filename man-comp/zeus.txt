NAME
       zeus - preload development tasks for slow codebases

SYNOPSIS
       zeus [--no-color] COMMAND [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       Zeus makes working with large codebases much less painful.

       It  is  primarily  targeted  at ruby and other dynamic languages, where
       application boot time can be tens of seconds, but it  can  be  made  to
       work for nearly any language.

       Zeus  lets  you	define	common	tasks, and preloads all of them in the
       background. When you ask to run them, zeus transparently connects  your
       terminal to the already-running process in under 100ms.

       This  lets  you, for example, run unit tests in dozens of milliseconds,
       rather than dozens of seconds.

       Zeus also optionally monitors all files loaded by your application, and
       restarts as much of it as is necessary when a dependency changes.

       To  use	zeus  with  a  Ruby  on  Rails	application,  install  the gem
       'zeus-rails'.
