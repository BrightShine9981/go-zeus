NAME
       zeus - Intelligent Application Multi-Preloader

SYNOPSIS
       zeus COMMAND [--no-color] [--verbose] [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       Zeus makes working with large codebases must less painful.

       It  it  primarily  targeted  at ruby and other dynamic languages, where
       application boot time can be tens of seconds, but can be made  to  work
       for nearly any language.

       Zeus works by booting your application up in stages, and accepting con-
       nections to transform a booted process into something  useful  (e.g.  a
       server).

       To  use	zeus  with  a  Ruby  on  Rails	application,  install  the gem
       'zeus-rails'.
